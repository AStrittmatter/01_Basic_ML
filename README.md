#Causal Machine Learning Course

This repository contains lecture slides from the "Causal Machine Learning" course taught by Anthony Strittmatter. The course covers foundational statistical and machine learning techniques relevant to causal inference.

** Lecture Contents:**

- Overview: The course starts with an introduction to causal machine learning, emphasizing the differences between predictive modeling and causal analysis.
- Regularized Regression: Topics include regularized regression methods like Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net, and their applications in identifying causal relationships.
- Trees and Forests: The lectures discuss decision trees and random forests, highlighting methods to optimize model complexity and improve predictive performance.
- Deep Learning: Basic concepts of deep learning models are introduced, focusing on their potential applications in causal inference.
